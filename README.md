# Dart Programming Language

Dart is a modern general-purpose, Object-oriented, open-source programming language developed by Google (designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund). Dart is a new programming language that appeared first time in 2007 so not many people know about Dart, the significant growth of Flutter made it more popular.

It is extensively used to create single-page applications. Single-page applications apply only to websites and web applications. Single-page applications enable navigation between different screens of the website without loading a different webpage in the browser. A classic example is GMail ─ when you click on a message in your inbox, the browser stays on the same webpage, but JavaScript code hides the inbox and brings the message body on screen.

Google has released a special build of Chromium – the Dart VM. Using Dartium means you don’t have to compile your code to JavaScript until you’re ready to test on other browsers. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script which can run on all modern web browsers.
It is also approved as a standard by ECMA and is used to build web, server, desktop, mobile applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform and is approved as a standard by ECMA to build web, server, desktop, mobile applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language experience for multi-platform development.
